PREFACE 

Welcome  to  the  exploration  of  Organic  Farming,  a  comprehensive 
guide  to  understanding  and  embracing  the  principles  and  practices  of 
cultivating  crops  and  raising  livestock  in  harmony  with  nature.  This  book 
delves into the core ethos of organic farming, offering insights into its origins, 
in  fostering  sustainable  and 
it  plays 
principles,  and 
environmentally friendly agricultural systems. 

the  vital  role 

Organic  Farming  represents  a  holistic  approach  to  farming  that 
emphasizes soil health, biodiversity, and ecological balance. As concerns about 
the  environmental  impact  of  conventional  agricultural  practices  grow,  the 
demand for sustainable and organic alternatives has never been greater. 

In  the  pages  that  follow,  we  will  embark  on  a  journey  through  the 
fundamentals  of  organic  farming,  exploring  topics  such  as  soil  management, 
crop rotation, pest control, and the vital role of organic matter. Additionally, we 
will  examine  the  importance  of  certifications,  standards,  and  regulations  that 
govern  the  organic  industry,  ensuring  that  consumers  can  make  informed 
choices about the food they consume. 

Throughout  this  book,  emphasis  is  placed  on  the  interconnectedness 
of  all  elements  within  an  organic  farming  system.  From  the  microscopic 
organisms  in  the  soil  to  the  complex  relationships  between  plants  and  their 
environment, every aspect  is considered  in  fostering a holistic and sustainable 
approach to agriculture. 

Whether you are a farmer seeking to transition to organic practices, a 
consumer  interested  in  making  informed  choices,  or  simply  a  curious  mind 
eager  to  explore  the  world  of  organic  farming,  this  book  aims  to  serve  as  a 
valuable  resource.  It  is  our  hope  that  by  delving  into  the  principles  and 
practices  outlined  here,  you  will  gain  a  profound  appreciation  for  the 
significance  of  organic  agriculture  in  building  a  resilient  and  ecologically 
sound future for our planet.

ORGANIC FARMING – MEANING  

Organic farming based on “Nature can provides for everyone's need but not for 

greed”…………Mahatma Gandhi 

The term ‘organic’ was first coined by Lord Northbourne, in 1940, in his book 

entitled ‘Look to the Land’. 

Organic  farming  is  an  agricultural  system  that  uses  ecologically  based  pest 

controls and biological fertilizers derived largely from animal and plant wastes 

and  nitrogen-fixing  cover  crops.  Modern  organic  farming  was developed  as  a 

response to the environmental harm caused by the use of chemical pesticides 

and  synthetic  fertilizers  in  conventional  agriculture,  and  it  has  numerous 

ecological  benefits.  Compared  with  conventional  agriculture,  organic  farming 

uses  fewer  pesticides,  reduces  soil  erosion,  decreases  nitrate  leaching  into 

groundwater and surface water, and recycles animal wastes back into the farm. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PRINCIPLES….. 

Organic farming and food processing practices are wide-ranging and necessitate 

the  development  of  socially,  ecologically,  and  economically  sustainable  food 

production  system.  The  International  Federation  of  Organic  Agriculture 

Movements (IFOAM) has suggested the basic four principles of organic farming, 

i.e. the principle of health, ecology, fairness, and care. The main principles and 

practices of organic food production are to inspire and enhance biological cycles 

in the farming system, keep and enhance deep-rooted soil fertility, reduce all 

types of pollution, evade the application of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, 

conserve genetic diversity in food, consider the vast socio-ecological impact of 

food production, and produce high-quality food in sufficient quantity (IFOAM, 

1998).

DEFINITIONS…. 

  Organic  Agriculture  is  a  production  system  that  sustains  the  health  of 

soils,  ecosystems,  and  people. 

It  relies  on  ecological  processes, 

biodiversity and cycles adapted to local conditions, rather than the use of 

inputs  with  adverse  effects.  Organic  Agriculture  combines  tradition, 

innovation, and science to benefit the shared environment and promote 

fair relationships and good quality of life for all involved. 

( IFOAM General Assembly ) 

  “organic farming is a system which avoids or largely excludes the use of 

synthetic inputs (such as fertilizers, pesticides, hormones, feed additives 

etc) and to the maximum extent feasible rely upon crop rotations, crop 

residues,  animal  manures,  off-farm  organic  waste,  mineral  grade  rock 

additives  and  biological  system  of  nutrient  mobilization  and  plant 

protection”. 

( USDA ) 

  “Organic agriculture is a unique production management system which 

promotes  and  enhances  agro-ecosystem  health,  including  biodiversity, 

biological cycles and soil biological activity, and this is accomplished by 

using on-farm agronomic, biological and mechanical methods in exclusion 

of all synthetic off-farm inputs”. 

(FAO) 

 
 
 
HISTORY 

The  concept  of  organic  farming  was  started  1,000  years  back  when  ancient 

farmer  started  cultivation  near  the  river belt  depending  on  natural  resources 

only. There is brief mention of several organic inputs in Indian ancient literature 

like Rig-Veda, Ramayana, Mahabharata and Kautilya Arthasashthra etc 

Source- NICHE Agriculture….. 

The concepts of organic agriculture were developed in the early 1900s by Sir 

Albert Howard, F.H. King, Rudolf Steiner, and others who believed that the use 

of  animal  manures,  cover  crops,  crop  rotation,  and  biologically  based  pest 

controls resulted in a better farming system. Howard, having worked in India as 

an  researcher,  gained  much  inspiration  from  the  traditional  and  sustainable 

farming practices he encountered there and advocated for their adoption in the 

West. Such practices were promoted by J.I. Rodale. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NEED FOR CONVERSION 

The  goal  of  organic  agriculture  is  to  contribute  to  the  enhancement  of 

sustainability. In the context of agriculture, sustainability refers to the successful 

management of agricultural resources to satisfy human needs while at the same 

time maintaining or enhancing the quality of the environment and conserving 

natural resources for future generations. Sustainability in organic farming must 

therefore be seen in a holistic sense, which includes ecological, economic and 

social aspects 

Source-Nature and more ……. 

Organic agriculture provides help on all three aspects, ie. 

Social & Economic sustainability and also provides good Market opportunities. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONSIDERATIONS 

Analysis of the Location 

The conversion from a conventional to an organic system requires a transitory 

period,  where  the  organic  practices  are  applied  progressively  following  an 

organized plan. During this period it is important to analyse carefully the actual 

situation  of  the  farm  and  identify  the  actions  to  be  taken  (Florez,  2003).  The 

analysis of the farm must include  

1.  Farm  characteristics:  size,  plots  and  crops  distribution,  which  kind  of 

crops, trees, animals are integrated in the farm system.  

2.  Soil Analysis: an evaluation of the soil structure, nutrient levels, organic 

matter content, erosion level, and/or the soil have been contaminated. 

3.  Climate:  rainfall  distribution  and  quantity,  temperatures,  frost  risks, 

humidity. 

4.  Organic matter sources and management (manures) 

Farm Related Challenges 

1.  Establishing a diverse and balanced farming system with a natural ability 

to   regulate itself usually takes several years. 

2.  Major  efforts  may  be  necessary  to  restore  natural  soil  fertility  by 

providing a considerable amount of organic matter to the soil. 

 
3.  Abandoning high input external fertilizers results in yield depression in the 

first years of conversion, before soil fertility is re-established and yields 

rise again. 

4.  New  approaches  and  practices  usually  involve  a  lot  of  learning  and 

intensive  observation  of  crop  development,  and  dynamics  of  pests, 

diseases and natural enemies. 

5.  Avoid burning of crop residues after harvest as this is, in most cases, not 

a viable solution, since it destroys valuable organic material and damages 

soil organisms. 

6.  Establish  a  well  organised  diversification  systems  including  a  ‘planned’ 

crop rotation and intercropping systems. 

7.  Accumulate knowledge and practice regarding efficient use of farm own 

resources, especially for compost production to manage and improve soil 

fertility.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Climate Related Challenges 

Converting a farm to organic farming in an area with very little rainfall and high 

temperatures or strong winds will be more challenging than converting a farm 

located in an area with well distributed rainfall and favourable temperatures.  

In very warm and dry climate, losses of water through transpiration from plants 

and evaporation from soils are high. These losses may be further encouraged by 

strong winds, enhancing soil erosion. The soils’ organic matter content is  

generally  low,  as  biomass  production  is  low,  implying  that  the  availability  of 

nutrients  to  the  plants  is  highly  reduced.  Under  such  conditions,  the  key  to 

increasing crop productivity lies in protecting the soil from strong sun and wind 

and increasing the supply of organic matter and water to the soil.  

Soil  organic  matter  can  either  be  increased  through  compost  or  through 

cultivation  of  green  manure  crops.  In  the  case  of  compost  production  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
challenge  is  to  increase  production  of  plant  biomass,  which  is  needed  for 

compost production. 

 In warm and humid climate, high aboveground biomass production and rapid 

decomposition of soil organic matter imply that the nutrients are easily made 

available to the plants. Under such conditions a balance between production 

and  decomposition  of  organic  matter  is  important  to  avoid  depletion  of  soil. 

Creating  a  diverse  and  multi-layer  cropping  system  ideally  including  trees, 

growing nitrogen-fixing cover crops in orchards and applying compost to enrich 

the soil with organic matter and in this way increase its capacity to retain water 

and nutrients.

STEP-BY-STEP CONVERSION 

STEP 1 : Good Information First  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basically,  farmers  who  are  interested  in  converting  their  farm  to  organic 

agriculture need to know: 

   

   

   

   

   

How to improve soil fertility. 

How to keep crops healthy. 

How to best increase diversity in the farm. 

How to keep livestock healthy. 

How to give value to organic products and how to successfully sell 

                 them. 

STEP 2 : Familiarise with Organic Practices   

  Mulching - Covering the soil with dead plant material is an easy way 

to control weeds and protect the soil in annual crops. This practice 

can be implemented into most existing cropping systems.  

  Intercropping - Growing two annual crops together, commonly a 

leguminous crop like beans or a green manure crop in alternating 

rows with maize or another cereal crop or vegetable is a common 

practice  in  organic  farming  to  diversify  production  and  maximize 

benefits from the land. In intercropping, special attention must be 

paid  to  avoid  competition  between  the  crops  for  light,  nutrients 

and water.  

 
 
 
  Composting - Application of compost to the fields can have a major 

impact on crop growth and yields. To get familiar with the process 

of  making  compost,  farmers  should  be 

instructed  by  an 

experienced  person.  Proper  compost  production  requires  some 

knowledge  and  experience  and  additional  labor,  but  is  low  in 

investments. 

  Green  manuring  -  The  practice  of  growing  a  leguminous  plant 

species for biomass production and incorporation into the soil may 

be  new  to  most  farmers.  Proper  green  manuring  first  requires 

information on appropriate species. 

  Organic pest management – Careful associations and management 

of  plants  and  animals  in  order  to  prevent  pest  and  disease 

outbreaks. Initially, bio-control agents may be applied but organic 

pest management is best achieved through ecological approaches 

that establish a pest/predator balance 

  Appropriate  seeds  and  planting  material  -  Use  of  healthy  seeds 

and planting materials, and robust and/or improved cultivars can 

make a big change in crop production.  

  Planting of leguminous trees - In perennial crop plantations such 

as banana, coffee or cocoa, planting of leguminous trees such as 

gliricidia,  calliandra,  and  sesbania  may  improve  the  growing 

 
 
 
 
conditions of the fruit crop by providing shade, mulching material 

and nitrogen through nitrogen fixation 

. 

  Terraces and soil bunds - Construction of terraces and soil bunds along 

the  curves  of  hills  is  a  key  measure  for  soil  conservation.  This  practice 

builds the foundation of further improvement to soil fertility on slopes. It 

is of high relevance, but requires much labor and some specific knowledge 

for appropriate implementation 

Crops to Grow During Conversion 

Besides growing crops for food, farmers may need to grow leguminous cover 

crops to provide high-protein feed for livestock and to be used as green manures 

to  feed  the  soil.  Planting  trees  for  shade,  as  windbreak,  for  firewood,  feed, 

mulching material or for other uses, can be recommended in most situations. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STEP 3 : Full Conversion to Organic Farming 

In a third step, implementation of organic practices throughout the entire farm 

should  be  considered,  once  sufficient  experience  with  different  practices  has 

been  gained.  As  soon  as  organic  practices  are  implemented  throughout  the 

entire farm, a farmer can claim to be an organic farmer. 

Commonly, consistent application of organic practices marks the beginning of a 

long process of improving the production system: 

1. 

Improving  soil  fertility  based  on  the  recycling  of  farm  own  organic 

materials and enhancement of farm own biomass production. 

2. 

Encouraging  positive  interactions  between  all  parts  of  the  production 

system (the farm ecosystem) to enhance self-regulation of pests and diseases. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 

Optimizing the balance between feed production and livestock. 

Farming  organically  also  means  continuously 

learning 

from  personal 

observation, from outside experiences, sharing experiences with other organic 

farmers  and  implementing  new  information  on  the  your  farm,  making  it 

increasingly more sustainable.

MULCHING IN ORGANIC SYSTEM 

Mulching  is  the  process  of  covering  the  topsoil  with  plant  material  such  as 

leaves,  grass,  twigs,  crop  residues,  straw  etc.  A  mulch  cover  enhances  the 

activity of soil organisms such as earthworms. They help to create a soil structure 

with  plenty  of  smaller  and  larger  pores  through  which  rainwater  can  easily 

infiltrate  into  the  soil,  thus  reducing  surface  runoff.  As  the  mulch  material 

decomposes, it increases the content of organic matter in the soil. 

USES 

  Protecting the soil from wind and water erosion: soil particles cannot be 

washed or blown away. 

  Improving  the  infiltration  of  rain  and  irrigation  water  by  maintaining  a 

good soil structure: no crust is formed, the pores are kept open 

   

  Keeping the soil moist by reducing evaporation: plants need less irrigation 

or can use the available rain more efficiently in dry areas or seasons 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Feeding  and  protecting  soil  organisms:  organic  mulch  material  is  an 

excellent food for soil organisms and provides suitable conditions for their 

growth 

  Suppressing weed growth: with a sufficient mulch layer, weeds will find it 

difficult to grow through it 

Selection of Mulch Material 

The kind of material used for mulching will greatly influence its effect. Material 

which easily decomposes will protect the soil only for a rather short time but will 

provide nutrients to the crops while decomposing 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Application of Mulch 

If  possible,  the  mulch  should  be  applied  before  or  at  the  onset  of  the  rainy 

season, as then the soil is most vulnerable.  

If the layer of mulch is not too thick, seeds or seedlings can be directly sown or 

planted in between the mulching material. On vegetable plots it is best to apply 

mulch only after the young plants have become somewhat hardier, as they may 

be harmed by the products of decomposition from fresh mulch material. 

If mulch is applied prior to sowing or planting, the mulch layer should not be too 

thick in order to allow seedlings to penetrate it. Mulch can also be applied in 

established crops, best directly after digging the soil. It can be applied between 

the  rows,  directly  around  single  plants  (especially  for  tree  crops)  or  evenly 

spread on the field.

WATER MANAGEMENT 

Scarcity of water for agriculture is a common phenomenon in many countries. 

In some regions it is almost impossible to grow crops without irrigation. Even in 

areas with large amounts of rainfall in the rainy season, crops may get short of 

water during dry periods. 

Organic  farming  aims  at  optimising  the  use  of  on-farm  resources  and  at  a 

sustainable use of natural resources. Active water retention, water harvesting 

and  storing  of  water  are  important  practices,  especially  for  organic  farmers. 

Organic  farmers  know  that  it  is  more  important  to  first  improve  the  water 

retention and the infiltration of water into the soil. 

Approaches  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Planting Pits 

Planting pits  are hand-dug circular holes which collect water and store it for use 

by the crop. Each pit is about 20 cm across and 20 cm deep. After planting, the 

holes are left partly open so they collect water. 

Contour Bunding & Catchment Strips 

In areas with low rainfall, there may not be enough water to grow a crop over 

the whole area. On gentle slopes (less than 3%), one possibility is to use contour 

bunds  and  catchment  strips.  Catchment  strips  are  areas  where  no  crops  are 

planted. When rain falls on this ground, it runs downslope and is trapped by the 

contour bund. Plant rows of crops behind the bund to use this water. This can 

produce  a good yield even with very little rain. Mulch the cultivated areas with 

crop residues to prevent erosion, help water sink in, and slow evaporation.

CROP PLANNING & MANAGEMENT 

Crop Rotation 

Crop rotation means changing the type of crops grown in the field each season 

or each  year .It  is  a  critical feature  of all  organic cropping  system, because  it 

provides  the  principal  mechanisms  for  building  healthy  soils,  a  major  way  to 

control pests, weeds, and to maintain soil organic matter). In more details, crop 

rotation brings the following benefits. 

•It improves soil structure: some crops have strong, deep roots. They can break 

up hardpans, and tap moisture and nutrients from deep in the soil. Others have 

many fine, shallow roots. They tap nutrients near the surface and bind the soil. 

They form many tiny holes so that air and water can get into the soil. 

•It increases soil fertility: legumes (such as groundnuts and beans) fix nitrogen 

in the soil. When their green parts and roots rot, this nitrogen can be used by 

other crops such as maize. The result is higher, more stable yields, without the 

need to apply expensive inorganic fertilizer. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 

It helps control weeds, pests and diseases: planting the same crop season 

after season encourages certain weeds, insects and diseases. Planting different 

crops breaks their life cycle and prevents them from multiplying. 

• 

It  produces  different  types  of  output:  growing  a  mix  of  grain,  beans, 

vegetables and fodder means a more varied diet and more types of produce to 

sell. 

General Recommendations 

  Grow  winter  cover  crops  BEFORE  late-planted  crops  to  accumulate 

organic matter and nitrogen. 

  Grow winter-killed cover crops (oat-pea) BEFORE early season crops, so 

the seedbed will be easy to prepare. 

  NEVER grow any crop after itself. 

  Certain insect pests and diseases may spread easily from one crop to the 

next through the crop residues. Avoid crop combinations where this is a 

problem. 

  Markets  do  not  always  exist  for  new  crops;  however  you  may  want  to 

plant some of them as part of your rotation. However. If your objective is 

marketing,  ensure  that  there  is  a  market  for  your  main  output  and 

rotation crops. 

 
 
 
Intercropping 

Intercropping  refers  to  the  practice  of  growing  two  or  more  crops  in  close 

proximity: growing two or more cash crops together, growing a cash crop with 

a cover crop, or other non-cash crop that provide benefits to the primary crop . 

When two or more crops are growing together, each must have adequate space 

to  maximize  cooperation  and  minimize  competition  between  them.  To 

accomplish this, four things need to be considered: 

Spatial  arrangement,  Plant  density,  Maturity  dates  of  the  crops  being  grown, 

Plant architecture. 

ROW  INTERCROPPING  WITH  ALTERNATE  ROWS  OF  MAIZE  AND  BEANS  (LEFT)  ROW  INTERCROPPING  WITH 
ALTERNATE ROWS OF A CEREAL AND A GRASS COVER CROP (RIGHT). 

There are at least four basic spatial arrangements used in intercropping. Most 
practical systems are variations of these: 

  Row intercropping 

  Strip intercropping 

  Relay intercropping 

  Mixed intercropping 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cover crops 

Every plant which covers the soil and improves soil fertility can be a cover crop. 
It could be a leguminous plant with other beneficial effects, or it could be a weed 
characterised  by  its  rapid  growth  and  enormous  production  of  biomass.  The 
most important property of cover crops is their fast growth and the capacity of 
maintaining the soil permanently covered. 

The following characteristics make an ideal cover crop - 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

The seeds are cheap, easy to get, to harvest, to store and to propagate 

Be of rapid rate of growth and be able to cover the soil in short time 

Be resistant against pests and diseases 

Produce large amounts of organic matter and dry material 

Fix nitrogen from the air and provide it to the soil 

Have a de-compacting root system and regenerate degraded soils 

Easy to sow and to manage as single crop or associated with other crops 

Can be used as fodder, grains as food grains

NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT 

Soil is a living system and soil fertility is the key to agricultural productivity. The 

maintenance  of  the  fertility  of  the  soil  is  the  primary  step  in  any  agricultural 

system. The plethora of microorganism inherent in any soil system ensures that 

nutrient  cycle  is  in  place  and  the  large  substrate  is  broken  down  to  minute 

particles that can be easy assimilated by the plant’s  root  system. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Composting 

Composting is the process of transforming organic materials of plant or animal 

origin into humus in heaps or pits. Compared with uncontrolled decomposition 

of organic material, decomposition in the composting process occurs at a faster 

rate, reaches higher temperatures and results in a product of higher quality. 

Within the process of composting, three main phases can be distinguished: the 

heating  phase,  the  cooling  phase  and  the  maturing  phase.  However,  these 

phases cannot be clearly separated from one another. 

Heating phase 

•Within 3 days of setting up the compost heap, the temperature in the heap    

rises to 60 to 70 °C and usually stays at this level for 2–3 weeks. Most of the 

decomposition occurs during the heating phase. 

•During this first phase of the composting process, the bacteria have a very high 

oxygen  demand  due  to  the  rapid  development  of  their  population.  High 

temperatures in the heap signal that there is an adequate supply of oxygen for 

the bacteria. If there is not enough air in the heap, bacterial development will 

be hindered and the compost will develop an unpleasant odour. 

Cooling phase 

•Once the material which is easily digested by the bacteria has been converted, 

the temperature in the compost heap declines slowly and will remain at 25–45 

°C. 

 
 
 
•With the decline in temperature, fungi settle and start the decomposition of 

straw, fibres and wooden material. As this decomposition process is slower, the 

temperature of the heap does not rise. 

•As  the  temperature  drops,  the  pH  of  the  composting  material  declines  (i.e. 

acidity increases). 

Maturing phase   

•During  the  maturing  phase  nutrients  are  mineralised  and  humic  acids  and 

antibiotics are built-up. 

•Red compost worms and other soil organisms start to inhabit the heap during 

this phase. 

•At the end of this phase the compost has lost about half of its original volume, 

has the colour of dark, fertile soil and is ready to use. 

•The longer it is stored from now on, the more it loses its quality as a fertilizer, 

while its capacity to improve soil structure increasesGree 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Green manuring 

Green  manures  are  plants  grown  to  accumulate  nutrients  for  the  main  crop. 

When they have built up maximum biomass, they are worked into the surface 

soil. As they are usually cut before flowering, growing a green manure is thus 

different from growing a legume crop in the rotation. Once worked into the soil 

the fresh plant material releases nutrients quickly and will be fully decomposed 

within a short period of time. Old or coarse material (e.g. straw, twigs, etc.) will 

decompose  at  a  slower  rate  than  fine  material  and  will  therefore  contribute 

more to the build-up of soil organic matter than to fertilizing the crop. 

An alternative to sowing a green manure crop in the field is to collect fresh plant 

material  from  elsewhere  and  work  it  into  the  soil.  For  example,  trees  and/or 

shrubs growing alongside crops in an agroforestry system may provide a large 

quantity of green material which can be used as green manure or for mulching. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Animal Manure 

Depending  on  whether  animals  are  kept  in  stables  or  not  (part  or  full  time), 

farmyard manure consists of animal excreta and bedding material (usually straw 

or grass). Farmyard manure is extremely valuable organic manure. 

Some characteristics and effects of farmyard manure: 

•It contains large amounts of nutrients. 

•Only part of the nitrogen content of manure is directly available to plants, while 

the  remaining  part  is  released  as  the  manure  decomposes.  The  nitrogen  in 

animal urine is available in the short-term. 

•When dung and urine are mixed, they form a well-balanced source of nutrients 

for plants. The availability of phosphorus and potassium from farmyard manure 

is similar to that from chemical fertilizers. Chicken manure is rich in phosphorus. 

However, it is important to be aware of the origin of the manure, as chicken 

manure from conventional farms is contaminated by heavy metals. 

•Organic  manures  contribute  to  the  build-up  of  soil  organic  matter  and  thus 

improve soil fertility. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Microbial and Mineral Fertilizer 

The microbial fertilizers mostly consist of organic material and some source of 

sugar  or  starch,  which  are  fermented  together  with  specific  species  of 

microorganisms.  The  products  are  living  organisms  and  need  to  be  applied 

cautiously. They should not be used when expired, since the organisms may be 

dead. 

Although  some  research  has  been  done  on  the  use  of  microorganisms  and 

positive effects may be proven, there is still little experience with such products. 

To find out the effect of a certain product, it is recommended to test them in 

small scale and compare with an untreated plot. Remember though: microbial 

fertilizers cannot substitute an appropriate humus management in the farm. 

Most of the bacteria and fungi present in the purchased products are generally 

present  in  soil.  Microbial  inocula,  therefore,  enhance  the  presence  of  the 

specific organisms. Some farmers make their own microbial fertilizers to save on 

costs. 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PEST & DISEASE MANAGEMENT 

Pest and disease management consists of a range of activities that support each 

other.  Most  management  practices  are  long-term  activities  that  aim  at 

preventing pests and diseases from  affecting a crop.  

Management  focuses  on  keeping  existing  pest  populations  and  diseases  low. 

Control on the other and is a short-term activity and focuses on killing pest and 

disease. The general approach in organic agriculture to deal with the causes of 

a problem rather than treating the symptoms also applies for pest and diseases. 

Therefore, management is of a much higher priority than control. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Things to Remember 

1)  Selection of adapted and resistant varieties: 

→  Choose  varieties  which  are  well  adapted  to  the  local  environmental       

conditions  (temperature,  nutrient  supply,  pests  and  disease  pressure),  as  it 

allows  them  to  grow  healthy  and  makes  them  stronger  against  infections  of 

pests and diseases. 

2)  Selection of clean seed and planting material: 

→ Use safe seeds which have been inspected for pathogens and weeds at all 

stages of production. 

→ Use planting material from safe sources. 

3)  Use  of  suitable  cropping  systems  (see  6.  Crop  Planning  and 

Management): 

→ Mixed cropping systems: can limit pest and disease pressure as the pest has 

less host plants to  feed on and more beneficial insect life in a diverse system. 

→ Crop rotation: reduces the chances of soil borne diseases and increases soil 

fertility. 

→ Green manuring and cover crops: increases the biological activity in the soil 

and  can  enhance  the  presence  of  beneficial  organisms  (but  also  of  pests; 

therefore a careful selection of the proper species is needed). 

4)  Use of balanced nutrient management: 

 
 
 
→  Moderate  fertilization:  steady  growth  makes  a  plant  less  vulnerable  to 

infection. Too much fertilization may result in salt damage to roots, opening the 

way for secondary infections. 

5)  Input of organic matter: 

→  Increases  micro-organism  density  and  activity  in  the  soil,  thus  decreasing 

population densities of pathogenic and soil borne fungi. 

→ Stabilises soil structure and thus improves aeration and infiltration of water. 

6)  Application of suitable soil cultivation methods: 

→ Facilitates the decomposition of infected plant parts. 

→ Regulates weeds which serve as hosts for pests and diseases. 

7)  Use of good water management: 

→ No  water logging: causes stress to  the plant, which encourages pathogens 

infections. 

→ Avoid water on the foliage, as water borne disease spread with droplets and 

fungal disease germinate in water. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
BIOOGICAL CONTROL 

Biological control is the use of natural enemies to manage populations of pests 

and  diseases.  This  implies  that  we  are  dealing  with  living  systems,  which  are 

complex and vary from place to place and from time to time. 

Natural  enemies  that  kill  or  suppress  pests  or  diseases  are  often  fungi  or 

bacteria. They are called antagonists or referred to as microbial insecticides or 

bio-pesticides. Some commonly used antagonistic microbes are: 

Bacteria  such  as  Bacillus  thuringiensis  (Bt).  Bt  has  been  available  as  a 

commercial  microbial  insecticide  since  the  1960s.  Different  types  of  Bt  are 

available  for  the  control  of  caterpillars  and  beetles  in  vegetables  and  other 

agricultural crops, and for mosquito and black fly control. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Viruses such as NPV (nuclearpolyhedrosis virus), effective for control of 

several  cater-pillar  pest  species.  Every  insect  species,  however,  requires  a 

specific. Many farmers in West-Sumatra are now producing NPV on-farm. 

Fungi that kill insects, such as Beauveria bassiana. Different strains of this 

fungus are commercially available. For example: strain Bb 147 is used for control 

of corn. 

Fungi  that  work  against  plant-pathogens.  Some  examples  include: 

Trichoderma sp., widely used in Asia for prevention of soil-borne diseases such 

as damping-off and root rots in vegetables . Some Trichogramma species against 

the  African  bollworm  are  bred 

in  some 

laboratories 

in  Africa  against 

lepidopteran pests and aphids.  

Other Methods 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1)  NEEM:  Neem  derived  from  the  neem  tree  (Azadiracta  indica)  of  arid 

tropical regions, contains several insecticidal compounds. The main active 

ingredient  is  azadiractin,  which  both  deters  and  kills  many  species  of 

caterpillars, thrips and whitefly. Neem cake (ground neem seed or neem 

kernel powder) has also a considerable potential as a fertilizer and at the 

same time it will hinder nematode attacks of the crop roots (e.g. tomato). 

Put neem cake in the planting pit (200g per m2) and mix it with substrate. 

The neem cake will repel and even kill nematodes and other root pests. 

Insecticidal agents (azadirachtin) will be translocated to above- 

2)  PYRETHRUM:  Pyrethrum  is  a  daisy-like  Chrysanthemum.  Pyrethrins  are 

insecticidal  chemicals  extracted  from  the  dried  pyrethrum  flower.  The 

flower heads are processed into a powder to make a dust. This dust can 

be used directly or infused into water to make a spray. Pyrethrins cause 

immediate paralysis to most insects 

3)  CHILLIPEPPER:  Chillies  and  capsicum  pepper  have  both  repellent  and 

insecticidal effects.     To make the chilli extract grind 200 g of chillies into 

a fine dust,  boil it in 4 L water, add another 4 L of water and a few drops 

of  liquid  soap.  This  mixture  can  be  sprayed  against  aphids,  ants,  small 

caterpillars and snails. 

4)  GARLIC:  Garlic  has  antifeedant  (insect  stop  feeding), 

insecticidal, 

nematicidal and repellent properties. Garlic is reportedly effective against 

a wide range of insects at different stages in their life cycle effect and can 

kill beneficial insects as well. Therefore, it should be used with caution.

SOIL CULTIVATION & TILLAGE 

Soil cultivation includes all mechanical measures to loosen, turn or mix the soil, 

such as ploughing, tilling, digging, hoeing, harrowing etc. Careful soil cultivation 

can  improve  the  soil‘s  capacity  to  retain  water,  its  aeration,  capacity  of 

infiltration, warming up, evaporation etc. But soil cultivation can also harm the 

soil fertility as it accelerates erosion and the decomposition of humus.

PLANT PROPAGATION 

The  choice  of  high  quality  organic  seed  and  plant  propagation  material  of 

suitable varieties is an important key to successful organic farming, allowing for 

improved yield and product quality, for crop resilience, considerate use of non-

renewable resources and for increased genetic and species diversity. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     Importance of Traditional Varaities 

• 

Traditional seeds are locally available because farmers collect good seeds 

from their own plots and keep them for the next season. 

• 

Farmers  either  buy or  exchange  their  seed  with  other  farmers  or  grow 

their own seeds. Therefore the cost of seeds is minimal. 

• 

Native  seeds  are  geared  to  a  subsistence  economy  as  the  farmers  first 

grow food for his subsistence and/or stock seed for the next season and market 

only the surplus. 

• 

Native seeds embody indigenous knowledge. A farmer who uses native 

seeds  use  his/her  traditional  knowledge,  skills  and  wisdom  to  grow  them, 

promoting self-reliance. 

• 

• 

An outstanding feature of native seeds is diversity. 

Native seeds are hardy, as they have, over the years, developed resistance 

to the pests and diseases.  

• 

Traditional seeds have high level of tolerance to conditions of stress and 

are adapted to local agro-climatic conditions.

ANIMAL HUSBANDRY IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE  

Integrating animal husbandry into crop producing farms is one of the principles 

of  organic  farming.  In  temperate  and  arid  zones,  animal  husbandry  plays  an 

important role in the recycling of nutrients, while it is less emphasised in the 

humid tropics. 

→ Produce dung which is of great importance for soil fertility.  

→ Yield products such as milk or eggs for sale or own consumption continuously. 

→ Recycle by-products such as straw or kitchen waste. 

→ Serve as draught animals for tillage or transport. 

→ Produce meat, hides, feathers, horns etc.

ORGANIC FARMING IN INDIA 

NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR ORGANIC PRODUCTION 

Organic products are grown under a system of agriculture without the use of 

chemical  fertilizers  and  pesticides  with  an  environmentally  and  socially 

responsible approach. This is a method of farming that works at grass root level 

preserving  the  reproductive  and  regenerative  capacity  of  the  soil,  good  plant 

nutrition, and sound soil management, produces nutritious food rich in vitality 

which has resistance to diseases. 

India  is  bestowed  with  lot  of  potential  to  produce  all  varieties  of  organic 

products  due  to  its  various  agro  climatic  conditions.  In  several  parts  of  the 

country, the inherited tradition of organic farming is an added advantage. This 

holds  promise  for  the  organic  producers  to  tap  the  market  which  is  growing 

steadily in the domestic and export sector. 

As  per  the  available  statistics,  India's  rank  9th  in  terms  of  World's  Organic 

Agricultural land and 1st in terms of total number of producers as per 2022 

data 

The  APEDA,  Ministry  of  Commerce  &  Industries,  Government  of  India  is 

implementing  the  National  Programme  for  Organic  Production  (NPOP).  The 

programme  involves  the  accreditation  of  Certification  Bodies,  standards  for 

organic production, promotion of organic farming and marketing etc. The NPOP 

standards  for  production  and  accreditation  system  have  been  recognized  by 

European  Commission  and  Switzerland  for  unprocessed  plant  products  as 

equivalent to their country standards. With these recognitions, Indian organic 

 
products  duly  certified  by  the  accredited  certification  bodies  of  India  are 

accepted by the importing countries. APEDA is also in the process of negotiation 

with South Korea, Taiwan, Canada, Japan etc. 

AREA 

As on 31st March 2021 total area under organic certification process (registered 

under National Programme for Organic Production) is 4339184.93 ha (2020-21). 

This includes 2657889.33 ha cultivable area and another 1681295.61 ha for wild 

harvest collection. Among all the states, Madhya Pradesh has covered largest 

area  under  organic  certification  followed  by  Rajasthan,  Maharashtra, 

Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Karnataka. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During  2016,  Sikkim  has  achieved  a  remarkable  distinction  of  converting  its 

entire cultivable land (more than 75000 ha) under organic certification. 

PRODUCTION 

India produced around 3496800.34 MT (2020-21) of certified organic products 

which includes all varieties of food products namely Oil Seeds, fibre, Sugar cane, 

Cereals  &  Millets,  Cotton,  Pulses,  Aromatic  &  Medicinal  Plants,  Tea,  Coffee, 

Fruits, Spices, Dry Fruits, Vegetables, Processed foods etc. The production is not 

limited to the edible sector but also produces organic cotton fiber, functional 

food products etc. 

Among  different  states  Madhya  Pradesh  is  the  largest  producer  followed  by 

Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. In terms of commodities 

Oil seeds are the single largest category followed by Sugar crops, Cereals and 

Millets,  Tea  &  Coffee,  Fiber  crops,  fodder,  Pulses,  Medicinal/  Herbal  and 

Aromatic plants and Spices & Condiments. 

EXPORTS 

The total volume of export during 2020-21 was 888179.68 MT. The organic food 

export  realization  was  around  INR  707849.52  Lakhs  (1040.95  million  USD). 

Organic products are exported to USA, European Union, Canada, Great Britain, 

Korea Republic, Israel, Switzerland, Ecuador, Vietnam, Australia etc. 

In terms of export value realization Processed foods including soya meal (57%) 

lead among the products followed by Oilseeds (9%), Cereals and millets (7%), 

Plantation crop products such as Tea and Coffee (6%), Spices and condiments 

(5%), Medicinal plants(5%), Dry fruits (3%), Sugar(3%), and others.

ORGANIC CERTIFICATION 

Though organic certification can be obtained for all types of agricultural produce 

including processed food and food served in restaurants. Large scale farmers or 

small  size  land  holder  growers  groups  (minimum  of  25  and  maximum  of  500 

farmers  having  lands  in  the  same  geographical  area)  can  apply  for  Organic 

certification  of  their  produce.  The  point  to  note  here  is  that  the  land  is  not 

certified as organic. Rather the produce from it is certified. 

APEDA offers an internet based e-service called Tracenet to collect, record and 

report data on organic certification and thus facilitating the process of organic 

certification. It is also used to trace any organic produce all the way to the farm 

from anywhere in the supply chain. 

Organic certification process is  carried out by accredited bodies under NPOP. 

Process of Organic certification  

  Receipt of application by any accredited organic certification body from 

farmer. 

  The certification body provides standards and operational documents to 

farmer(s). 

  There is an agreement of roles and commitments between the farmer(s) 

and the body. 

  Demand of fees by accredited body. 

  Document audit. 

  Regular Field inspection by internal quality system manager and external 

inspector and documentation of the same. 

  Compliance verification through inspection and audits. 

  Preparation of reports by the field inspector. 

  Review of report by a reviewing body. 

  Decisions on certification. 

The field inspection is one of the most important process step in Organic 

certification in India. Here is a summary of the inspection methods. 

  Visit of external inspector to fields and facilities. 

  Review of records and accounts. 

  Calculation  of  input  and  output  norms  and  preparation  of  production 

estimate from a farm. 

  Assessment of production system 

  Interview with responsible person(s). 

  Risk assessment from neighboring farms. 

  Inspection of use of any GM products. 

  Inspection of use of off-farm inputs. 

  Analysis  of  residue  tests  by  certified  laboratories  for  pesticides,  heavy 

metals if required. 

  Inspection of sustainable practices. 

  Inspection and study of entire production unit. 

  Organic  certificate  for  any  produce  is  valid  for  3  years  only.  It  must  be 

renewed after expiry of 3 years.

INITIATIVES BY GOVERNMENT   

The  Government  of  India  provides  assistance  for  promoting  organic  farming 

across the country though different schemes. 

1. Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) 

Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana promotes cluster based organic farming with 

PGS (Participatory Guarantee System) certification. Cluster formation, training, 

certification and marketing are supported under the scheme. Assistance of Rs. 

50,000 per ha /3 years is provided out of which 62 percent (Rs. 31,000) is given 

as incentive to a farmer towards organic inputs. 

2.  Mission  Organic  Value  Chain  Development  for  North  Eastern  Region 

(MOVCDNER) 

The  scheme  promotes  third  party  certified  organic  farming  of  niche  crops  of 

north east region through Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) with focus on 

exports. Farmers are given assistance of Rs 25,000 per hectare for three years 

for  organic  inputs  including  organic  manure  and  bio-fertilisers  among  other 

inputs.  Support  for  formation  of  FPOs,  capacity  building,  post-harvest 

infrastructure up to Rs 2 crore are also provided in the scheme. 

 
 
 
 
 
3.Capital  Investment  Subsidy  Scheme  (CISS)  under  Soil  Health  Management 

Scheme 

Under  this  scheme,  100  percent  assistance  is  provided  to  state  government, 

government agencies for setting up of mechanised fruit and vegetable market 

waste, agro waste compost production unit up to a maximum limit of Rs 190 

lakh per unit (3000 Total Per Annum TPA capacity). Similarly, for individuals and 

private agencies assistance up to 33 percent of cost limit to Rs 63 lakh per unit 

as capital investment is provided. 

4. National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP) 

Under the Mission, financial assistance at 50 percent subsidy to the tune of Rs. 

300  per  hectare  is  being  provided  for  different  components  including  bio-

fertilisers, supply of  Rhizobium culture, Phosphate Solubilising Bacteria (PSB), 

Zinc Solubilising Bacteria (ZSB), Azatobacter, Mycorrhiza and vermi compost. 

5. National Food Security Mission (NFSM) 

Under  NFSM,  financial  assistance  is  provided  for  promotion  of  bio-fertiliser 

(Rhizobium/PSB) at 50 percent of the cost limited to Rs 300 per hectare. 

As  per  international  resource  data  from  Research  Institute  of  Organic 

Agriculture  (FiBL)  and  the  International  Federation  of  Organic  Agriculture 

Movements  (IFOAM)  Statistics  2020,  India  stands  at  9th  position  in  terms  of 

certified agricultural land with 1.94 million hectare (2018-19). 

 
 
 
 
BENEFITS 

Benefits of organic farming 

Better Taste and More Nutrition 

Fruits and vegetables that are organically raised have a much better taste than 

other mechanically farmed ones. This is  due to the fact that they are given a 

much  longer  time  to  develop  and  are  not  pumped  with  artificial  things.  The 

sugar structures in these crops have more time to mature and develop into a 

tasty and nutritious product. 

Reduces pesticide and chemical residue in soil 

Organic farming minimizes the use of pesticides and chemicals thereby reducing 

the major environmental issues. It ensures the health of soil, water, air and flora 

and  fauna.  Also  reduces  the  major  environmental  issues  like  soil  erosion,  air 

pollution, water pollution etc. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Promotion of Biodiversity 

Crop rotation to build soil fertility and raising animals naturally helps promote 

biodiversity, which promotes greater health across all living species. As organic 

farms provide safe havens to wildlife, local ecosystems also improve.  

Consumes Less Energy 

Organic farming does not rely on the use of synthetic fertilizers as opposed to 

conventional  techniquesthat  are  generous  with  these  external  chemicals. 

Avoiding fertilizers contributes to a greater cause of energy conservation. This is 

because manufacturing synthetic fertilizers consumes a significant amount of 

energy. On average, it’s safe to say that the energy usage is lower by at least 30-

50% in the organic farming systems.  

Long-term sustainability 

Organic  farming  is  a  long-term,  sustainable  approach  to  food  production. 

Organic  farming  takes  a  proactive,  preventative  approach  instead  of  dealing 

with problems after they emerge which can be too 

Reduced erosion and better water management 

Both  soil  improvement  and  the  concept  of  keeping  the  ground  “covered”  as 

much as possible, either by mulches or cover crops, reduces soil erosion. Soils 

with  improved  structure  and  higher  content  of  organic  matter  and  the  more 

compact growth of an organic crop also reduces the water consumption in 

Agriculture The farming techniques are based on how well a farmer can make 

the best use of his immediate natural resources . 

 
 
Conclusion 

 The phenomenon of ‘Organic agriculture’ is the only solution to nurture the land 

and to regenerate the soil by going back to our traditional method of farming 

i.e., free from chemicals, pesticides and fertilizers. 

This  is  a  possible  step  for  sustainable  development  by  choosing  not  to  use 

chemicals, synthetic materials, pesticides and growth hormones to produce high 

nutritional quality food and in adequate quantities.Organic farming is an option

composts  of  natural  starting  points,  for  example,  fertilizer  excrement,green 

excrement, and bone feast and so forth substantially more than deciding not to 

utilize pesticides,fertilizers.

Major Problems and Constraints 

Lack of Awareness: 

The  most  important  constraint  felt  in  the  progress  of  organic  farming  is  the 

inability  of  the  government  policy  making  level  to  take  a  firm  decision  to 

promote organic agriculture. 

Unless  such  a  clear  and  unambiguous  direction  is  available  in  terms  of  both 

financial and technical supports, from the Centre to the Panchayat levels, mere 

regulation making will amount to nothing. Many farmers in the country have 

only  vague  ideas  about  organic  farming  and  its  advantages  as  against  the 

conventional farming methods. 

Use of bio-fertilizers and bio pesticides requires awareness and willingness on 

the  part  of  the  farming  community.  Knowledge  about  the  availability  and 

usefulness of supplementary nutrients to enrich the soil is also vital to increase 

productivity. Attention on the application of composts/organic manure is also 

lacking. 

The organic matter is spread during the months when the right moisture level is 

absent  on  the  soil.  The  whole  manure  turns  into  wastes  in  the  process.  The 

required operation is of course labour intensive and costly, but it is necessary to 

obtain the desired results. 

 
 
 
 
Output Marketing Problems: 

It is found that before the beginning of the cultivation of organic crops, their 

marketability and that too at a premium over the conventional produce has to 

be  assured.  Inability  to  obtain  a  premium  price,  at  least  during  the  period 

required  to  achieve  the  productivity  levels  of  the  conventional  crop  will  be  a 

setback. 

Shortage of Bio-mass: 

Many experts and well informed farmers are not sure whether all the nutrients 

with  the  required  quantities  can  be  made  available  by  the  organic  materials. 

Even if this problem can be surmounted, they are of the view that the available 

organic matter is not simply enough to meet the requirements. 

Inadequate Supporting Infrastructure: 

In spite of the adoption of the NPOP during 2000, the state governments are yet 

to formulate policies and a credible mechanism to implement them. There are 

only four agencies for accreditation and their expertise is limited to fruits and 

vegetables, tea, coffee and spices. The certifying agencies are inadequate. 

High Input Costs: 

The small and marginal farmers in India have been practicing a sort of organic 

farming in the form of the traditional farming system. They use local or own farm 

renewable resources and carry on the agricultural practices in an ecologically 

friendly environment. However, now the costs of the organic inputs are higher 

than those of industrially produced chemical fertilizers and pesticides including 

other inputs used in the conventional farming system. 

 
 
Marketing Problems of Organic Inputs: 

Bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides are yet to become popular in the country. There 

is a lack of marketing and distribution network for them because the retailers 

are not interested to deal in these products, as the demand is low. The erratic 

supplies  and  the  low  level  of  awareness  of  the  cultivators  also  add  to  the 

problem. 

Higher  margins  of  profit  for  chemical  fertilizers  and  pesticides  for  retailing, 

heavy  advertisement  campaigns  by  the  manufacturers  and  dealers  are  other 

major problems affecting the markets for organic inputs in India. 

Low Yields: 

In many cases the farmers experience some loss in yields on discarding synthetic 

inputs on conversion of their farming method from conventional to organic. 

Restoration  of  full  biological  activity  in  terms  of  growth  of  beneficial  insect 

populations,  nitrogen  fixation  from  legumes,  pest  suppression  and  fertility 

problems will take some time and the reduction in the yield rates is the result in 

the interregnum. It may also be possible that it will take years to make organic 

production possible on the farm. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FUTURE ASPECTS  

Organic farming yields more nutritious and safe food. The popularity of organic 

food  is  growing  dramatically  as  consumer  seeks  the  organic  foods  that  are 

thought  to  be  healthier  and  safer.  Thus,  organic  food  perhaps  ensures  food 

safety from farm to plate. The organic farming process is more eco-friendly than 

conventional  farming.  Organic  farming  keeps  soil  healthy  and  maintains 

environment integrity thereby, promoting the health of consumers. Moreover, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the organic produce market is now the fastest growing market all over the world 

including India.  

Organic agriculture promotes the health of consumers of a nation, the ecological 

health of a nation, and the economic growth of a nation by income generation 

holistically. India, at present, is the world’s largest organic producers (Willer and 

Lernoud, 2019) and with this vision, we can conclude that encouraging organic 

farming in India can build a nutritionally, ecologically, and economically healthy 

nation in near future. 

Organic agriculture will prosper in India and will contribute in feeding 1.5 billion 

people by 2030. According to statistics by Assocham and TechSci, the organic 

farming market in India will reach around $1.36 billion by 2020 with a growth 

rate of 25-30% per year. Organic farming is rapidly growing in India and investors 

agree  that  challenges  do  exist  in  this  sector  but  as  soon  as  awareness  and 

educational  training  about  the  benefits  and  the  set-up  of  organic  farming  is 

spread to the farmers, a positive economic outcome will follow.
